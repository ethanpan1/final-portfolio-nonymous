          <h3>Part 1: The Initial Design</h3>
          My group chose to design for Quell, a tech company in the fitness gaming market. Quell's selling point
          centers around a unique, harness-style gaming console with a custom combat fitness game, so we designed
          a desktop website for users to learn more about Quell and pre-order their own Quell System.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our design process started with multiple sets of cursory sketches. We took the best parts of each sketch
          to produce an initial hi-fi prototype.

          <h3>Part 2: The Critique</h3>
          We presented our prototype to our section and an industry critic. After testing it out, they provided us
          with the following feedback.

                    <td>We reworked the pages to have a clearer information flow. In addition, we added more content to the landing page and added a More Info page for users to learn more about the console and the packages it comes in.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row">2</th>
                    <td>The website seems to cater to gamers while the product is meant for both fitness enthusiasts and gamers.</td>
                    <td>We included more information in the How It Works section on the fitness side of Quell to appeal to that audience (e.g., calories burned).
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row">3</th>
                    <td>It's difficult to tell how well the UI works because of the filler text and placeholder images.</td>
                    <td>We filled in all of the text and found more relevant photos, which was only difficult because the assingment disallowed us from using any official Quell photos.</td>
                  </tr>

                  <tr>
                    <th scope="row">4</th>
                    <td>General style issues such as multiple fonts, over-saturated colors, etc.</td>
                    <td>We chose more similar fonts (one for headings, one for body text), desaturated the colors, and made other minor stylistic changes (like a custom logo).</td>
                  </tr>

          The changes we made resulted in our final prototype.

          <h3>Part 3: The User Test</h3>
          I helmed my group's user test, which we hosted over <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a>.
          I designed a test plan for three users to follow.

                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                Please note: This is an interactive mockup made on
                prototyping software rather than a working website. Enter the given URL into the address bar. Once the 
                prototype is open, clicking anywhere on the page will show you the clickable elements. Imagine you are
                looking for an alternative way of working out through gaming. Please pre-order one of the Quell packages
                and return to the home page.

                  <li>Without leaving the homepage, describe what you would select first. <em>Do not select anything yet.</em> If you would leave without clicking anywhere, please explain why.</li>
                  <li>Learn about Quell by clicking through the tabs. Find the general pre-order page.</li>
                  <li>Purchase the Quell System Package. How easy is it to make a purchase?</li>
                  <li>Return to the home page.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

                <h5>Post-Test Questionnaire</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>If this were not a study, would you have quit at any point during the process of purchasing the product?</li>
                  <li>Does the website entice you to buy the Quell?</li>
                  <li>How would you describe the website in three words?</li>
                  <li>How would you compare it with similar websites?</li>

          For the most part, the UserTesting results were in line with our expectations. Users
          found the interface clear and easy to use, all successfully completing the subtasks. 
          We received positive feedback about the layout, clarity, and learnability of the site. 
          Especially since we did not state that we are students, this feedback indicates high success. 
          Nevertheless, there were still further changes we could make.

                on the home page to lead to the same page as the How It Works tab.</li>

          <h3>Major Takeaways</h3>
          <b>Design user tests to be as easy to follow as possible.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>This included giving proper background information and delineating all of the subtasks.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Feedback from multiple sources is critical to the design process.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Multiple rounds of feedback greatly increased the usability of our prototype. A diversity of testers contributed to more holistic and helpful criticism.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Usability operates at multiple levels.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Usability principles can often be at odds with each other (e.g., concision vs. explanation). Striking a balance is of utmost importance.</li>
