          <h3>Part 1: An Elementary Idea</h3>
          In the spring of my freshman year, I co-founded Students for Educational Equity. Our mission is to expand 
          educational equity for Providence Public School students through activism and social action. An important part
          of our ethos is centering community (especially youth) voices and leveraging our positionality as Brown 
          students to enact change within the University. 
          <br>
          <br>
          As such, a long-term project we seek to contribute to is the development of a Providence Public School District (PPSD) 
          to Brown pipeline, which would rectify the historically low representation of PPSD students at Brown. To this end, we
          are conducting this survey on how educational background affects the Brown undergraduate experience.

            <figcaption >PPSD's Hispanic, Black, and Economically Disadvantaged populations are particularly large</figcaption>
          </figure>
          This idea came from thinking about PPSD students' usual perception of Brownâ€”inaccessible, elitist, not for them. 
          Even I, as a student from a fairly wealthy public school, have felt intimidated by the private school culture that
          often runs in Brown circles. Thus, I developed an idea for this survey that could substantiate these
          intuitions and point to weaknesses in Brown's academic and social resources. By addressing these weaknesses, Brown 
          could be a place where PPSD students actually want to go. I hope that this is another step we can take
          to make Brown a more positive contributor to the Providence community.

          <h3>Part 2: The Middle Bits</h3>
          I led a six person team through the survey design process, which involved three main steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Drafting a list of topics we wanted to ask about</li>
            <li>Writing and organizing questions to fit those topics</li>
            <li>Revising the survey according to pilot feedback</li>
          </ol>
          
          The pilot feedback was especially helpful in identifying issues with terminology and survey length. After
          finalizing our survey questions, we used Brown's Qualtrics platform to draft a final prototype.

          <h3>Part 3: Higher Standards</h3>
          Currently, the survey project is on hiatus, as the finishing of the survey coincided with finals. As such,
          the team decided that the survey would be more successful if deployed at the beginning of next semester.
          We plan on using regression analysis to find response patterns based on educational background, and we
          plan to use the written responses to derive specific recommendations for the school.

          <h3>Major Takeaways</h3>
          <b>Iterative design principles can be applied to user research design.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The process of iterative design (especially regarding prototyping) is a useful paradigm for other work, including user research techniques like surveys.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>When managing a team, set expectations clearly and early in the process.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Setting clear actionables, modeling appropriate work, and frontloading major decision-making were key to a smooth team workflow.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Utilise techniques to maximize a survey taker's engagement.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple question structures (e.g., multiple choice vs. matrix table) and effective organization can ensure survey takers complete the survey.</li>
