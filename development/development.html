          <h3>Part 1: Tough Cheese</h3>
          For this assignment, I created a cheese shop app called La Fromagerie, with a list interface serving 
          as a display case for the cheeses and an aggregator serving as a shopping cart. The goal of 
          the app is to help users know about the cheeses they're buying and provide an easy shopping experience. 
          <br>
          <br>
          My target audience is the consumer who is interested in entering the cheese world but does not know where
          to begin. Especially because of COVID, many food retailers have taken to the internet to sell their wares,
          but without the help of real-life cheesemongers, buyers can be lost in a sea of unfamiliar cheese names.
          Thus, the buying experience may be frustrating, intimidating, or confusing enough to stop them from purchasing at all.

        </div>
        <div class="part">
          <h3>Part 2: Get That Cheddar</h3>
          My app serves as a model for online cheese shops by provide more cheese information up-front to the buyers.
          Filters and sorts help buyers find the cheese they're looking for, while additional descriptive info allows
          them to know what they're in for. My app also streamlines the buying process by placing the display case 
          and the cart on the same page, much like a real cheese shop.
          <div class="row justify-content-center mt-4 mb-4">

              <source src="Cheese-Vid.mov" type="video/mp4">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
          </div>
          I considered a number of usability principles while designing the interface.
          <div class="row justify-content-center  mt-3">
              <div class="col ">
                <table class="table">
                  <thead class="thead-light">
                    <th scope="col">Principle</th>
                    <th scope="col">Implementation</th>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">Interaction</th>
                      <td>Filters, sorts, and buttons are clearly labelled. Correct interactions are made obvious (e.g., hover states).</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">Layout</th>
                      <td>The cart is separated from the display case. Nice flow from filtering/sorting, to adding to cart, to checking out.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">Text</th>
                      <td>Information for each cheese is succinctly presented and displayed in both the display case and the cart.</td>
                    </tr>
    
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">Accessibility</th>
                      <td>Color choices and font/image size are readable. Image alts are provided. Completely responsive except for mobile sizes.</td>
                    </tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
          </div>
          
        </div>


        <div class="part">
          <h3>Part 3: Cheesy Come, Cheesy Go</h3>
          I also focused on the readability and extensibility of my code. I created a clear architecture with
          multiple components to keep my code flexible and reusable. I tried to strike a balance between factoring
          out common code and maintaining readability; for example, I used one Card class to handle CSS styling, 
          but I created separate DisplayCard and CartCard components because they used different functions. 
          I also made sure to write comments for every component and function.

          <h3>Major Takeaways</h3>
          <b>Consider what knowledge the user brings to the interface.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The specific usage of the filters and sorts came from understanding what a cheese buyer would need to know before making a purchase.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Usability comes from both functionality and visual design.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>It is important to provide useful functionalities while also keeping other usability principles (layout, concision) in mind.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Code readability and efficiency can sometimes be at odds.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Reducing the number of lines in your code does not always mean it's easier to understand. Sometimes, two objects are better than one, even if they share similarities.</li>
